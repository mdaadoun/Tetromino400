## **Super Tetris Game Devlog**

I start today the development of a Tetris clone, my inspiration come from the gameboy/nes version mostly.

I have vaguely an idea about a grid system that could work fine with this game, I need to make differents tests to be sure.

I started today by drawing on paper all the assets and screen I will need for the game, it give me an overall reference that I will use as I develop the game.

I find out than this kind of drawing/concept art or technical/design document are very helpful when we spend a lot of time later on little details. At some point we are so focused on them than it is good to have the opportunity to step back and see globally what we are doing.

For a game like tetris, I won't forget what the game is about, but still, it is good habit to take to keep somewhere what I am actually doing and not start from zero at some point just because I forgot what I wanted to do.
