# PiTetromino400

## A free and open source clone of a famous copyrighted brick gameplay.

* Made with Python and Pygame on and for the Raspberry Pi 400.

### Features :

* In full color (up to 8 color displaying simulatenously on the screen !!)
* With modern sounds (borrowed so probably copyrighted, see contribute.)
* Technological innovation : Choose your gaming style : play with the keyboard or the gamepad.
* Multiplayer : The 10 best scores are saved in a separate file (save.xml) that you can mail on a disk to your friend to compete with.

### Contribute :

To be a bit more serious, it was more of a learning project where the goal was to complete a full game with Python but if you want to add features or improve it, don't hesitate to fork and propose pull requests. I like the idea to have a library of open source games with a eigties feel for the RPI400 like it was an old amiga or atari.

Also I used sounds and a font that I found but I don't believe have a compatible open source licence, if you can help me to make this game FLOSS compatible, that would help it to distribute without more trouble from the big brick game company. 

* The font source url :
* The sound source url :

### Releases for the RPI400 :

* here and on itchio, as .deb package 

### Start the game from source :

It should work fine with any python 3 installation, but careful it requires the recent pygame 2 release (will bug with 1.9 versions).

In the root directory :

```
python game.py
```

Sounds licence is unknown.
